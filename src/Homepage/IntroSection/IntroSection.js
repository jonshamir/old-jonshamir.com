        <h1>Hi, I'm Jon Shamir</h1>
        <p>
          I recently graduated from a 5-year program combining computer science
          & design. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and art:
          graphics, typography, machine learning, generative art, data viz and
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience with various technologies and mediums. I love
          working on projects that combine different fields and use technology
          in new and interesting ways. I am inspired by nature and have a
          special affinity for plants ðŸŒ±
